# FlipWitch - Forbidden Sex Hex for PopTracker

This is a manual item tracker for [PopTracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases) to use with FlipWitch.

This is the first tracker I've made, so I'm fully expecting some of the inner logic to not be completely perfect. For normal use on a standard playthrough however, it should be perfectly stable!

## Installation

Just download the lastest build and put in your packs folder (zipped or unzipped work either way).

The packs folder can be under `USER/Documents/PopTracker/packs`, `USER/PopTracker/packs` or `APP/packs`, where `USER` stands for your user directory and `APP` for the PopTracker installation directory.

## Future Plans

Some things I want to add in the future include:
* Improve Logic
* Refining the Item Tracker
* <s>Implement autotracking with use of an upcoming Archipelago implementation of the game</s> (Finished! Next release will feature AP Autotracking, which will release alongside the APWorld/Game Mod.)
* Wack any bugs with muh magic wand
